Intern task with Java.

The Vehicle Rental System is a Java application designed to simplify the management of vehicle rentals, including cars, motorcycles, and cargo vans. The system automates the calculation of rental and insurance costs and generates detailed invoices for customers.

## Main Functions
### 1. Rental Cost Calculation
Calculates rental costs based on the type of vehicle and the rental period.
Each vehicle type (car, motorcycle, cargo van) has its own rate structure and rules for rental cost calculation.
### 2. Insurance Cost Calculation
Computes insurance costs based on vehicle value and additional parameters like driver age, driver experience, and vehicle safety ratings.
Provides conditional adjustments:
Motorcycles: Additional insurance cost for drivers under 25.
Cargo Vans: Insurance discount for drivers with more than 5 years of experience.
Cars: Insurance discount for vehicles with a safety rating of 4 or 5.
### 3. Invoice Generation
Calculates and generates detailed invoices that include all the information needed by the customer.
